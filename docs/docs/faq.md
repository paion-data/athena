I Use IntelliJ. Is There Any Way to Easily Sync up with Athena's Code styles
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For the moment, we have distilled the most important code style conventions with respect to Athena's code as IntelliJ
settings. If you are using IntelliJ, you may import these code style settings by importing the
[Athena-Project-intellij-code-style.xml] file in the root of the repo. The setting for the project will appear as a new
Scheme named *Athena-Project* under IntelliJ's `Editor -> Code Style` section.

Alternatively, you might check the xml file that is included in the jar and map its settings to your development
environment.
